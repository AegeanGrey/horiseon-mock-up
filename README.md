# horiseon-mock-up-01

The goal of this project was to navigate through provided code and to improve it in the following ways:

  - Organize elements and attributes between the index.html and CSS Style Sheet so that they are cohesive to compare side by side
  - Condense and simplify given code to achieve the webpages end goal with less lines of code
  - Properly assign/associate elements between the index.html and CSS Style Sheet
  - Provide ease of accessiblity for the end-user through correct links and description for images

I wanted to approach this scenario without aid and using what resources were provided through my class to achieve these goals and these were the results of that.
